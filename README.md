Purpose is to learn time series with machine learning. 

Using the weather data from the year 2013 to 2017. I was able to identify and predict tempreture results using ARIMA. In addition to the analysis, hyper parameter tuning was applied and validation. 

There are two format used. First is using jupyter notebook and the second is using python scripts. 

** For airflow ultilization please visit the airflow_pipeline repository

How to run:
1. terminal >> python a_pipeline.py
2. output >> image of prediction and y_test

Future works:
Docker implimentation
Application on other cities
Different model
